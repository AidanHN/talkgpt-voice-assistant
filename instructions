# python needs to be version 3.6+ to run script due to dependences 
1. "python --version"

# install openai(chatgpt) python-dotenv(create .env) speechrecognition(i wonder) pyttsx3(tts) numpy(calcs) pyaudio(access speaker + mic from python script)
2. "pip install openai python-dotenv speechrecognition pyttsx3 numpy pyaudio"

# raspberry pi settings for choosing speaker
3. sudo raspi-config : go to system -> audio -> choose speaker

# lsusb will list all usb devices 
4. plug mic in, make sure it's recognized. to check if recognized use command "lsusb" 

# install audio packages
5. "sudo apt-get install alsa-utils"

# this will list audio devices. remember num that mic is. should start with "card"
6. "arecord -l"

# this will set your mic as default
7. "sudo nano /usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf" find these two lines '; defaults.ctl.card 0' and '; defaults.pcm.card 0'
then remove the semicolon, and change the number to the number of your mic (refer to step 6). Save with Ctrl+O, exit with Ctrl+X.

# test mic
8. "arecord -f cd -D hw:1 | aplay". if you hear a sound, everything is okay so far.

# use script!!
9. use "cd folder_name" then "python talk-gpt-main.py"(refer to P.S.S) and everything should work!!



P.S if you get a libespeak error on the raspberry pi, use this to resolve issue "sudo apt-get install libespeak1"

P.S.S the script talk-gpt-main.py is avalible on https://github.com/System32hasBROKE/talkgpt-voice-assistant/blob/main/talk-gpt-main.py
